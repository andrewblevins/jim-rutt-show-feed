Simon DeDeo is an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University in the Department of Social and Decision Sciences, and External Professor at the <a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~simon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Santa Fe Institute</a>. He is also affiliated with the Cognitive Science program at Indiana University, where he runs the Laboratory for Social Minds. For three years, from 2010 to 2013, he was an Omidyar Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute.

He and his collaborators study how people use words and signals, and the ideas they represent, to create a world. They have studied a diverse set of systems that includes the French Revolution, the courtrooms of Victorian London, the research strategies of Charles Darwin, the insurgency of modern-day Afghanistan, the emergent bureaucracy of Wikipedia, the creation of power hierarchies among the social animals, and the collusions and conspiracies of petrol stations in the American Midwest. They combine data from the contemporary world, archives from the deep past, statistical tools from cosmology, and models of human cognition from Bayesian reasoning and information theory to understand how cultures grow, flourish, innovate, and evolve.

This is the first, experimental episode of Who Are You, a subseries of the Jim Rutt Show in which Jim has an unplanned conversation with a mystery guest nominated and elected by listeners. In this episode he meets <a href="https://twitter.com/threefoldsun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seth Jordan</a>, a writer focusing on the social ideas of Rudolf Steiner. They discuss Steiner’s view of society, the differences between complicated &amp; complex &amp; between operating systems &amp; organisms, the contingency of human systems &amp; methods of nudging, starting with human nature, a tripartite picture of government functions, breaking society into political, economic, and cultural realms &amp; whether they should be kept separate, the dominance of culture by the economic realm, organizing at the meso-scale, the Amish &amp; other intact local cultures, giving full autonomy to educators, the post-WWI creation of the nation-state &amp; the advantages of separating nation from state, making participation a reality, moving from “me” to “we,” honoring cross-cultural autonomy, separation of church &amp; state, the challenge of community coherence, and much more.

Lee Smolin is a theoretical physicist who has been since 2001 a founding and senior faculty member at <a href="https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics</a>. His main contributions have been so far to the quantum theory of gravity, to which he has been a co-inventor and major contributor to two major directions, loop quantum gravity and deformed special relativity.

Lee also contributes to cosmology, through his proposal of cosmological natural selection — a falsifiable mechanism to explain the choice of the laws of physics. He has also contributed to quantum field theory, the foundations of quantum mechanics, theoretical biology, and the philosophy of science and economics. He is the author of more than 150 scientific papers and numerous essays and writings on science.

Lee also has written four books which explore philosophical issues raised by contemporary physics and cosmology. These are: <em>Life of the Cosmos</em> (1997), <em>Three Roads to Quantum Gravity</em> (2001), <em>The Trouble with Physics</em> (2006), and <em>Time Reborn</em> (2013). Most recently, he coauthored <em>The Singular Universe and The Reality of Time</em> with Roberto Mangabeira Unger.

<a href="https://civilizationemerging.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Schmachtenberger</a> is a founding member of The Consilience Project, aimed at improving public sensemaking and dialogue. The throughline of his interests has to do with ways of improving the health and development of individuals and society, with a virtuous relationship between the two as a goal. Towards these ends, he’s had particular interest in the topics of catastrophic and existential risk, civilization and institutional decay and collapse as well as progress, collective action problems, social organization theories, and the relevant domains in philosophy and science. Motivated by the belief that advancing collective intelligence and capacity is foundational to the integrity of any civilization, and necessary to address the unique risks we currently face given the intersection of globalization and exponential technology, he has spoken publicly on many of these topics, hoping to popularize and deepen important conversations and engage more people in working towards their solutions. Many of these can be found here.

COS is enabling open and reproducible research practices worldwide. Brian is also a Professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Virginia. He received his Ph.D. from Yale University in 2002.

Brian co-founded <a href="http://projectimplicit.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Implicit</a>, an multi-university collaboration for research and education investigating implicit cognition — thoughts and feelings that occur outside of awareness or control. Brian investigates the gap between values and practices, such as when behavior is influenced by factors other than one's intentions and goals. Research applications of this interest include implicit bias, decision-making, attitudes, ideology, morality, innovation, and barriers to change. Nosek applies this interest to improve the alignment between personal and organizational values and practices.

Jill Tarter received her Bachelor of Engineering Physics Degree with Distinction from Cornell University and her Master’s Degree and a Ph.D. in Astronomy from the University of California, Berkeley. She served as Project Scientist for NASA’s <a href="https://www.seti.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SETI</a> program, the High Resolution Microwave Survey, and has conducted numerous observational programs at radio observatories worldwide.

Since the termination of funding for NASA’s SETI program in 1993, she has served in a leadership role to secure private funding to continue the exploratory science. Currently, she serves on the management board for the Allen Telescope Array, an innovative array of 350 (when fully realized) 6-m antennas at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory, it will simultaneously survey the radio universe for known and unexpected sources of astrophysical emissions, and speed up the search for radio emissions from other distant technologies by orders of magnitude.

Jill is a frequent speaker for science teacher meetings and at museums and science centers, bringing her commitment to science and education to both teachers and the public. Many people are now familiar with her work as portrayed by Jodie Foster in the movie <em>Contact</em>.

David Brin is best-known for shining light — plausibly and entertainingly — on technology, society, and countless challenges confronting our rambunctious civilization. His bestselling novels include <em>The Postman</em> (filmed in 1997) plus explorations of our near-future in <em>Earth</em> and <em>Existence</em>. Other novels are translated into over 25 languages. His short stories explore vividly speculative ideas. Brin's nonfiction book <em>The Transparent Society</em> won the American Library Association's Freedom of Speech Award for exploring 21st century concerns about security, secrecy, accountability and privacy.

As a scientist, tech-consultant and world-known author, he speaks, advises, and writes widely on topics from national defense and homeland security to astronomy and space exploration, SETI and nanotechnology, future/prediction, creativity, and philanthropy. <em>Urban Developer Magazine</em> named him one of four World's Best Futurists, and he was cited as one of the top 10 writers the AI elite follow.

Bonnitta Roy teaches insight practices for individuals who are developing meta-cognitive skills, and hosts collective insight retreats for groups interested in breaking away from limiting patterns of thought. She teaches a masters course in consciousness studies and transpersonal psychology at the Graduate Institute. Her teaching highlights the embodied, affective and perceptual aspects of the core self, and the non-egoic potentials from which subtle sensing, intuition and insight emerge.

Through her company, APP-AI, Bonnitta is developing applications that can visualize changing patterns as teams work through complex problems. Her research shows how simple but powerful protocols that underlie these patterns can be used to represent various dispositional states of human systems. Bonnitta is the author of the popular Medium publication <em>Our Future at Work</em>. She is an associate editor of <em>Integral Review</em> where you can also find her articles on process approaches to consciousness, perception, and metaphysics.

Stuart Kauffman is a professor at the University of Calgary with a shared appointment between biological sciences and physics and astronomy. He is also the leader of the Institute for Biocomplexity and Informatics (IBI) which conducts leading-edge interdisciplinary research in systems biology. Dr. Kauffman is also an emeritus professor of biochemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, a MacArthur Fellow and an external professor at the Santa Fe Institute.

Originally a medical doctor, Dr. Kauffman's primary work has been as a theoretical biologist studying the origin of life and molecular organization. Thirty-five years ago, he developed the Kauffman models, which are random networks exhibiting a kind of self-organization that he terms "order for free." Dr. Kauffman was the founding general partner and chief scientific officer of The Bios Group, a company (acquired in 2003 by NuTech Solutions) that applies the science of complexity to business management problems. He is the author of <em>The Origins of Order</em>, <em>At Home in the Universe: The Search for the Laws of Self-Organization</em>, Investigations, and <em>Reinventing the Sacred: A New View of Science, Reason, and Religion</em>.

Pamela McCorduck is the author of eleven published books, four of them novels, seven of them non-fiction, mainly about aspects of artificial intelligence. She’d first met AI when she was an undergraduate English major at Berkeley, and became steeped in the culture at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon Universities. In 1979 she published the first modern history of artificial intelligence, <em>Machines Who Think</em>, a book said to have influenced a generation of young AI researchers. Her latest book, <em>This Could Be Important: My Life and Times with the Artificial Intelligentsia</em>, is memoir, social history, and group biography of the founding fathers of AI, and describes the friendships, professional and personal, that laid the foundation for her continuing fascination with AI. McCorduck lived for 40 years in New York City until family called her back to California where she now lives in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Jordan is the Co-founder and Executive Chairman of the <a href="https://neurohacker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neurohacker Collective</a>. He is now in his 17th year of building disruptive technology companies. Jordan’s interests in comics, science fiction, computers, and way too much TV led to a deep dive into contemporary philosophy (particularly the works of Gilles Deleuze and Manuel DeLanda), artificial intelligence and complex systems science, and then, as the Internet was exploding into the world, a few years at Harvard Law School where he spent time with Larry Lessig, Jonathan Zittrain and Cornel West examining the coevolution of human civilization and technology.

Forrest Landry is a philosopher, writer, researcher, scientist, engineer, craftsman, and teacher focused on metaphysics, the manner in which software applications, tools, and techniques influence the design and management of very large scale complex systems, and the thriving of all forms of life on this planet. Forrest is also the founder and CEO of Magic Flight, a third-generation master woodworker who found that he had a unique set of skills in large scale software systems design. Which led him to work in the production of several federal classified and unclassified systems, including various FBI investigative projects, TSC, IDW, DARPA, the Library of Congress Congressional Records System, and many others.

Ken McCarthy was one of the earliest and most effective evangelists of the movement to commercialize the Internet. Ever click on a banner ad? Ever calculate a click-through rate? Ever send an email with commercial intent? These things had an origin. Ken had a hand in all of them and was literally present at their creation. Ken was also one of the first to see the potential of and use the then-new pay-per-click ad platforms back when clicks were uniformly priced at a dime each. He was one of the earliest advocates of Google AdWords which had a lot of trouble gaining traction, let alone comprehension, in its first year.

As a writer, Hanzi combines in-depth knowledge of several sciences and disciplines and offers maps of our time and the human condition with his characteristically accessible, poetic and humorous writing style – challenging the reader’s perspective of herself and the world. He epitomizes much of the metamodern philosophy and can be considered a personification of this strand of thought.

An important new thinker only comes around every few years. Tyson Yunkaport is that thinker right now. We talk about his amazing new book, Sand Talk, in which he looks at the meta-crisis of our contemporary scene through the dual lenses of complexity science and his Indigenous Australian culture. We talk about: his Apalech Clan &amp; personal background, impacts of smartphones, defining civilization, growth vs increase paradigms, managing change via myths &amp; norms, contextual dynamics of pronouns, the interconnection of culture &amp; bioregions, language &amp; cognition, the impermanent nature of race, collapse, the great filter theory, dangers of cultural narcissism &amp; the value of facing ordeal, crime &amp; punishment, safety vs protection, the value of conflict &amp; violence, human domestication via civilization, relationality vs fight &amp; flight, human potential, 'the art of yarning' &amp; stories as maps, our indigenous instincts, and more.

Nick uses the examination of fictional characters to illuminate his flat mind theory while attacking depth psychology. He uses cognitive science research findings to support his theory. Some of the topics we discuss include: the grand illusion &amp; visual processing, perceptual processing &amp; memory, object perception, dynamics of memory, attention, the illusion of background processing, principals &amp;/or heuristics in human cognition, the generality of intelligence, defining emotion, confabulation, the mind to culture process, and more.

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://civilizationemerging.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Schmachtenberger</a> is a founding member of The Consilience Project, aimed at improving public sensemaking and dialogue. The throughline of his interests has to do with ways of improving the health and development of individuals and society, with a virtuous relationship between the two as a goal. Towards these ends, he’s had particular interest in the topics of catastrophic and existential risk, civilization and institutional decay and collapse as well as progress, collective action problems, social organization theories, and the relevant domains in philosophy and science. Motivated by the belief that advancing collective intelligence and capacity is foundational to the integrity of any civilization, and necessary to address the unique risks we currently face given the intersection of globalization and exponential technology, he has spoken publicly on many of these topics, hoping to popularize and deepen important conversations and engage more people in working towards their solutions. Many of these can be found here.</p>

As a writer, Hanzi combines in-depth knowledge of several sciences and disciplines and offers maps of our time and the human condition with his characteristically accessible, poetic and humorous writing style – challenging the reader’s perspective of herself and the world. He epitomizes much of the metamodern philosophy and can be considered a personification of this strand of thought.

William J. Perry served as the U.S. Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering in the Carter administration and then as Secretary of Defense in the Clinton administration. He oversaw the development of the strategic nuclear systems that are currently in our arsenal. His new offset strategy ushered in the age of stealth, smart weapons, GPS, and technologies that changed the face of modern warfare. In 2007, Dr. Perry collaborated with George Shultz, Sam Nunn, and Henry Kissinger to publish several ground-breaking editorials in the<i> Wall Street Journal</i> that linked the vision of a world free from nuclear weapons with urgent but practical steps that could be taken to reduce nuclear dangers. Perry’s 2015 memoir, <i>My Journey at the Nuclear Brink</i>, is a personal account of his lifelong effort to reduce nuclear dangers. He founded the William J. Perry Project to educate the public on these dangers. In 2020 Perry co-authored <i>THE BUTTON: The New Nuclear Arms Race and Presidential Power from Truman to Trump</i>. He is the Michael and Barbara Berberian Professor (emeritus) at Stanford University.

Tom Z. Collina is Director of Policy at Ploughshares Fund. He is the co-author with William J. Perry of <i>THE BUTTON.</i> Tom has thirty years of Washington, DC, experience in nuclear weapons, missile defense, and nonproliferation issues, and has held senior positions at the Arms Control Association, the Institute for Science and International Security, and the Union of Concerned Scientists. He has been directly involved with efforts to end U.S. nuclear testing, limit ineffective anti-missile programs, extend the Nonproliferation Treaty, and secure Senate ratification of the New START Treaty. He has published widely in major magazines and journals and has appeared frequently in the national media, including the New York Times, CNN, and NPR. He has testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and regularly briefs congressional staff. Tom has a degree in International Relations from Cornell University.

Jason is obsessed with narrowing the gaps of agriculture. An apostle of relay cropping, Mauck, is blazing a new path using cash and cover crops in unison. One middle at a time, the maverick grower is uncovering clues and running wide open toward greater farming efficiency. Jason works 3,000 acres of corn, soybeans and wheat, in addition to 25,000 hogs per year. His company, Constant Canopy, is developing cutting-edge farming methods and currently holds the Indiana state record for the highest yield per acre for soybeans and has developed scalable systems for corn yields that surpass most high-test plots.

Forrest Landry is a philosopher, writer, researcher, scientist, engineer, craftsman, and teacher focused on metaphysics, the manner in which software applications, tools, and techniques influence the design and management of very large scale complex systems, and the thriving of all forms of life on this planet. Forrest is also the founder and CEO of Magic Flight, a third-generation master woodworker who found that he had a unique set of skills in large-scale software systems design. Which led him to work in the production of several federal classified and unclassified systems, including various FBI investigative projects, TSC, IDW, DARPA, the Library of Congress Congressional Records System, and many others.

Dennis P. Waters received his Ph.D. in 1990 from the <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/ssie/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watson Engineering School</a> at Binghamton University, where his advisor was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_H._Pattee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Howard Pattee</a>. Rather than travel the academic road, Waters became a serial entrepreneur, founding and selling several technical publishing businesses. Since retiring from business, Waters has returned to the research project that inspired his Ph.D., how one-dimensional patterns of DNA, language, and computer code orchestrate the behavior of the three-dimensional world in which we live.

Songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, writer and music educator Harvey Reid has honed his craft since the 1970's in countless clubs, festivals, streetcorners, cafes, schools and concert halls across the nation. He has been called a "giant of the steel strings" and "one of the true treasures of American acoustic music," and is considered to be one of the modern masters and innovators of the acoustic guitar, autoharp and 6-string banjo. He has absorbed a vast repertoire of American contemporary and roots music and woven it into his own colorful, personal and distinctive style. His 32 recordings on the Woodpecker record label showcase his mastery of many instruments and styles of acoustic music, from hip folk to slashing slide guitar blues to bluegrass, old-time, Celtic, ragtime, and even classical. <a href="http://www.woodpecker.com/harveyreid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Full Bio Here</a>

After a career in Silicon Valley, Gary pursued passion projects, studying astrophysics and philosophy. He’s spent the last two decades thinking about how to live a balanced, meaningful life in a rapidly evolving technological world. This self-reflective journey infuses his novel with insights about our future and the challenges we will face in finding purpose.

Before turning to writing speculative fiction, Gary worked in a variety of Silicon Valley tech companies. He was eBay’s Chief Financial Officer, and led the company’s initial and secondary public offerings. Gary has an MBA from Harvard Business School, and an MA in philosophy from San Francisco State University. He has two children with Cynthia, his wife of forty-three years. When not traveling the world, he raises bees and makes a nice Cabernet at the family’s Napa vineyard. He and his family live in San Francisco.

Jim talks with <a href="https://mflb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forrest Landry</a> about his Small Group Method and the obstacles to scaling it up. They discuss why studying group processes is important, the difficulty of doing new things with old structures, 3 classes of decision-making structures (consensus, meritocracy, &amp; democracy), advantages &amp; disadvantages of each, how to use each model as a check against the other two, treating internal &amp; external work as separate, votes of no confidence, democracy as a red button to suspend consensus, the uncanny valley between small- and large-scale governance process, a good governance architecture that emerges past 200 people, how to involve an entire community in choice-making, layered governance architecture as a complex organism, why new cryptocurrencies, voting reforms, &amp; other incremental improvements misunderstand the problem, underestimating the value of the earth, moving beyond creating &amp; exploiting niches, outlining the characteristics of a solution, proto-Bs as theory-practice-theory loops, and much more.

Forrest Landry is a philosopher, writer, researcher, scientist, engineer, craftsman, and teacher focused on metaphysics, the manner in which software applications, tools, and techniques influence the design and management of very large scale complex systems, and the thriving of all forms of life on this planet. Forrest is also the founder and CEO of Magic Flight, a third-generation master woodworker who found that he had a unique set of skills in large-scale software systems design. Which led him to work in the production of several federal classified and unclassified systems, including various FBI investigative projects, TSC, IDW, DARPA, the Library of Congress Congressional Records System, and many others.

Iain McGilchrist is a former Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, an associate Fellow of Green Templeton College, Oxford, a Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a Consultant Emeritus of the Bethlem and Maudsley Hospital, London, a former research Fellow in Neuroimaging at Johns Hopkins University Medical School, Baltimore, and a former Fellow of the Institute of Advanced Studies in Stellenbosch. He now lives on the Isle of Skye, off the coast of North West Scotland, where he continues to write, and lectures worldwide. He is committed to the idea that the mind and brain can be understood only by seeing them in the broadest possible context, that of the whole of our physical and spiritual existence, and of the wider human culture in which they arise – the culture which helps to mould, and in turn is moulded by, our minds and brains.

They discuss whether the continuity of time matters on the human scale, randomness as a real attribute of the universe, differentiating between unpredictability &amp; randomness, deterministic chaos, the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, consciousness as an ontological primitive vs a biological process, separating consciousness from intelligence, animacy as a matter of degree, a non-reductionist view of purpose, finite vs infinite games &amp; intrinsic vs extrinsic purpose, the purpose(s) of a white-tailed deer, the meaning of teleology, a drive toward increased complexity in life, the self-domestication of humans, relating the many-worlds idea to right-hemisphere damage, reasons to reject arguments from infinity, the odds of extraterrestrial intelligence, the lesson of paradoxes, and much more.</div>

Iain McGilchrist is a former Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, an associate Fellow of Green Templeton College, Oxford, a Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a Consultant Emeritus of the Bethlem and Maudsley Hospital, London, a former research Fellow in Neuroimaging at Johns Hopkins University Medical School, Baltimore, and a former Fellow of the Institute of Advanced Studies in Stellenbosch. He now lives on the Isle of Skye, off the coast of North West Scotland, where he continues to write, and lectures worldwide. He is committed to the idea that the mind and brain can be understood only by seeing them in the broadest possible context, that of the whole of our physical and spiritual existence, and of the wider human culture in which they arise – the culture which helps to mould, and in turn is moulded by, our minds and brains.

Professor Terrence W. <span class="il">Deacon</span> has held faculty positions at Harvard University, Harvard Medical School, Boston University, and the University of California, Berkeley. His laboratory research has combined human evolutionary biology and neuroscience, with the aim of investigating the evolution of human cognition. This work extends from cellular-molecular neurobiology and cross-species fetal neural transplantation to the study of semiotic processes underlying animal and human communication, especially language. These topics are explored in his 1997 book, <em>The Symbolic Species: The Coevolution of Language and the Brain</em>. Currently, his theoretical interests have focused on the problem of explaining emergent phenomena, in such unprecedented transitions as the origin of life, the evolution of language, and the generation of conscious experience by brains. His 2012 book, <em>Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter</em>, explores how the interrelationships between thermodynamic, self-organizing, evolutionary, and semiotic processes are implicated in the production of these emergent transitions.

<div>Jim talks with Bobby Azarian about the ideas in his new book <i>The Romance of Reality: How the Universe Organizes Itself to Create Life, Consciousness, and Cosmic Complexity</i>, which Jim calls "the most Jim Rutt Show-ish book ever." They discuss the meaning &amp; limits of reductionism, why the universe may not be moving toward an increasingly disordered state, life as a channel for dissipating energy, dissipative adaptation, self-organization as Darwinian process, the Fermi paradox, an evolutionary arms race of complexity, biology as knowledge creation, the emergence of agency, the Bayesian Brain Hypothesis, how symbolic thought opens up design space, the probability of complex life, teleology at local &amp; universal scales, Teilhard de Chardin's omega point, global workspace theory, phenomenal vs access consciousness, whether the internet is a global brain, applying the weak &amp; strong anthropic principle to multiverse theory, cosmological natural selection, life as central to reality, and much more.</div>

<div><b></b>Jim talks with Curtis Yarvin about his proposal to replace our current government with a monarchy, part of an ongoing exploration of problems with and alternatives to democracy. They discuss a regime-change thought experiment beginning with liquid democracy, the goals of democracy &amp; the feeling of being in charge, why our government doesn't actually have an executive branch, democracy's broken steering linkage, the negative characterization of "politics," optimizing liquid democracy to take &amp; hold power, delegation as power projection, why the French people didn't revolt against the Jacobins, forces that led to Trump's election, the relationship between binding &amp; power, the Yellow Vest protests, the problem of finding a philosopher-king, democracy as a claim to legitimacy, our minimal level of political activation, Julius Caesar's innovation, joyous regime change, monarchy as a unifying force, polarization as a product of institutional design, monarchic regimes in recent history &amp; their relevance, and much more.</div>

Canadian-born Dr. Bruce Damer has spent his life pursuing two questions: <em>how did life on Earth begin? </em>and<em> how can we give that life (and ourselves) a sustainable pathway into the future and a presence beyond the Earth?</em> A decade of laboratory and field research with his collaborator Prof. David Deamer at UCSC and teams around the world resulted in the <em>Hot Spring Hypothesis for an Origin of Life</em>, published in Scientific American in 2017 and the journal Astrobiology in 2020. The scenario has now passed its first key experimental tests in the laboratory and at volcanic hot springs around the world and has emerged as a leading contender for a general theory of abiogenesis. Implications of the work are now spreading through evolutionary biology, philosophy, AI and the search for life beyond Earth. New work with collaborators has proposed the <em>urability</em> framework, how life can start on many different worlds, and addresses some aspects of the Fermi Paradox.

Canadian-born Dr. Bruce Damer has spent his life pursuing two questions: <em>how did life on Earth begin? </em>and<em> how can we give that life (and ourselves) a sustainable pathway into the future and a presence beyond the Earth?</em> A decade of laboratory and field research with his collaborator Prof. David Deamer at UCSC and teams around the world resulted in the <em>Hot Spring Hypothesis for an Origin of Life</em>, published in Scientific American in 2017 and the journal Astrobiology in 2020. The scenario has now passed its first key experimental tests in the laboratory and at volcanic hot springs around the world and has emerged as a leading contender for a general theory of abiogenesis. Implications of the work are now spreading through evolutionary biology, philosophy, AI and the search for life beyond Earth. New work with collaborators has proposed the <em>urability</em> framework, how life can start on many different worlds, and addresses some aspects of the Fermi Paradox.

Forrest Landry is a philosopher, writer, researcher, scientist, engineer, craftsman, and teacher focused on metaphysics, the manner in which software applications, tools, and techniques influence the design and management of very large scale complex systems, and the thriving of all forms of life on this planet. Forrest is also the founder and CEO of Magic Flight, a third-generation master woodworker who found that he had a unique set of skills in large-scale software systems design. Which led him to work in the production of several federal classified and unclassified systems, including various FBI investigative projects, TSC, IDW, DARPA, the Library of Congress Congressional Records System, and many others.

Peter Turchin is a complexity scientist who works in the field of historical social science that he and his colleagues call <a href="http://peterturchin.com/cliodynamics/"><em>Cliodynamics</em></a>. His research interests lie at the intersection of social and cultural evolution,  historical macrosociology, economic history and cliometrics, mathematical modeling of long-term social processes, and the construction and analysis of historical databases. Currently his main research effort is directing <a href="http://seshatdatabank.info/">the Seshat Databank project</a> (and its offshoot, <a href="https://seshatdatabank.info/seshat-projects/crisis-and-recovery-database/">CrisisDB</a>) which builds and analyzes a massive historical database that enables us to empirically test predictions from theories attempting to explain why and how complex human societies evolved, and why they periodically experience political breakdown.

<div dir="auto"><span class="il">Aydan</span> <span class="il">Connor</span> has worked as a professional craft beer brewer in the Midwest for eight years, and has participated in the buildout of multiple brewery startups. At the beginning of his career, he was brewing batches as small as 10 gallons. Over the years, he worked directly with packaging equipment of various types, even leading as an operator of a mobile canning line to package onsite for other breweries. Currently, he works as a beer brewer at a regional craft brewery, brewing batches as large as 8,000 gallons. Employing direct knowledge of food processing, he has a vision for intelligent food systems which synthesize basic equipment and facilities technologies in combination with block chain inventory management towards decreasing food waste and increasing quality on any parameter. He believes these systems could act as a generative ground for building communities more awake and aware of the environments in which we can thrive.</div>

Matthew Pirkowski works at the intersection of software, psychology, and complex systems. These interests first took root while studying Evolutionary Psychology and assisting with Behavioral Economic research at Yale’s Comparative Cognition Laboratory. From there Matthew began a career in software engineering, where he applied these interests to the development of software interfaces used by millions around the world, most notably as a member of Netflix’s Television UI team, where he worked on experimental initiatives conceptualizing and prototyping the future of entertainment software.

Presently, Matthew is building the underlying modeling architecture at Bioform Labs, a company focused on using the Active Inference toolkit to model organizations as emergent cybernetic organisms. He believes these models can help organizations manage their deployment of and interaction with AI-based agents, as well as more adaptively manage their own emergent complexity.

<div>Jack Visnjic is a classicist and historian of philosophy interested in uncovering long-term patterns in history. He earned his PhD from Princeton University with a dissertation on the origins of the notion of moral duty. He later expanded that project into a book titled <em>The Invention of Duty: Stoicism as Deontology.</em> For several years he was director of research at the Anacyclosis Institute, a think tank which seeks to understand the trajectory of modern democracy by studying the long history of democracies. And his biggest passion is his podcast <em>Ancient Greece Declassified, </em>through which he strives to make the Classics accessible and relevant to a broad audience.</div>

Katherine Gehl is the originator of Final Five Voting (FFV)—a new election system designed to positively transform the incentives driving our dysfunctional politics. In 2020, Gehl published <em>The Politics Industry: How Political Innovation Can Break Partisan Gridlock and Save Our Democracy </em>(with co-author Michael Porter of Harvard Business School). Her work applied a competition lens and classic tools of industry analysis to politics for the first time. Today, Gehl leads the national Campaign for Final Five Voting which she co-founded with leaders across the political spectrum.

Jordan Hall is the Co-founder and Executive Chairman of the <a href="https://neurohacker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neurohacker Collective</a>. He is now in his 17th year of building disruptive technology companies. Jordan’s interests in comics, science fiction, computers, and way too much TV led to a deep dive into contemporary philosophy (particularly the works of Gilles Deleuze and Manuel DeLanda), artificial intelligence and complex systems science, and then, as the Internet was exploding into the world, a few years at Harvard Law School where he spent time with Larry Lessig, Jonathan Zittrain and Cornel West examining the coevolution of human civilization and technology.

Jeremy Sherman, PhD, describes his work as “cradle to grave”: from the chemical origins of life to humankind’s grave situation. For nearly thirty years, Sherman has been a lead collaborator with Harvard/Berkeley neuroscientist/biological anthropologist Terrence Deacon. Together with other collaborators they have been developing a gap-free explanation for the emergence of telos and semiotics –selves struggling for their own existence (i.e. self-regenerating) from within nothing but physical entropic degeneration.

He is also affiliated with the Cognitive Science program at Indiana University, where he runs the Laboratory for Social Minds. For three years, from 2010 to 2013, he was an Omidyar Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute. He and his collaborators study how people use words and signals, and the ideas they represent, to create a world. They have studied a diverse set of systems that includes the French Revolution, the courtrooms of Victorian London, the research strategies of Charles Darwin, the insurgency of modern-day Afghanistan, the emergent bureaucracy of Wikipedia, the creation of power hierarchies among the social animals, and the collusions and conspiracies of petrol stations in the American Midwest. They combine data from the contemporary world, archives from the deep past, statistical tools from cosmology, and models of human cognition from Bayesian reasoning and information theory to understand how cultures grow, flourish, innovate, and evolve.</div>

<span class="il">Alexander</span> <span class="il">Bard</span> is a philosopher, artist, songwriter and music producer, author of six books with Jan Söderqvist, living in Stockholm, Sweden. <span class="il">Bard</span> built his career as a philosopher in parallel with a highly successful 25-years-plus career in the international music industry. <span class="il">Bard</span> &amp; Söderqvist's philosophy concentrates on the relationship between human beings and technology, using human beings as the constant throughout civilization, with technology as the ever faster changing variable. Their work takes inspiration from thinkers like Hegel, Nietzsche, Whitehead, Deleuze, and Eastern philosophy and spirituality, in the latter case adding Persia to the well known triad of India, China and Japan. They are convinced philosophy will be the last human activity to ever be affected by AI.

<div>Jordan Hall tries to convince Jim that the reality of the Christian God is logically necessary.

<div>Jordan Hall is the Co-founder and Executive Chairman of the <a href="https://neurohacker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neurohacker Collective</a>. He is now in his 17th year of building disruptive technology companies. Jordan’s interests in comics, science fiction, computers, and way too much TV led to a deep dive into contemporary philosophy (particularly the works of Gilles Deleuze and Manuel DeLanda), artificial intelligence and complex systems science, and then, as the Internet was exploding into the world, a few years at Harvard Law School where he spent time with Larry Lessig, Jonathan Zittrain and Cornel West examining the coevolution of human civilization and technology.</div>

<span class="il">Carolyn</span> Dicey <span class="il">Jennings</span> explores whether it is possible for us to direct our own minds through attention and, if so, what impact this has on other functions of the mind. She has training in philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience and combines these fields to approach fundamental questions about the nature of the mind, including the existence of the self, the foundation of consciousness, and the possibility of a free will. She has published three books, two monographs with Cambridge University Press (<i>The Attending Mind</i>, 2020 and <i>Attention and Mental Control</i>, 2022) and an edited volume (<i>Mind, Cognition, and Neuroscience: A Philosophical Introduction</i>, 2022 with Ben Young). She is currently working on a new project, on “collective attention,” which intersects with recent digital technologies.

Jordan Hall is the Co-founder and Executive Chairman of the <a href="https://neurohacker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neurohacker Collective</a>. He is now in his 17th year of building disruptive technology companies. Jordan’s interests in comics, science fiction, computers, and way too much TV led to a deep dive into contemporary philosophy (particularly the works of Gilles Deleuze and Manuel DeLanda), artificial intelligence and complex systems science, and then, as the Internet was exploding into the world, a few years at Harvard Law School where he spent time with Larry Lessig, Jonathan Zittrain and Cornel West examining the coevolution of human civilization and technology.

Thomas is co-founder of <a href="http://delodi.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://delodi.net&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1751492713044000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0kLS99it7kIYkjcU2a6Fo8">delodi.net</a>, a mission-driven software studio and the engine behind the not-for-profit initiatives MOTHERLAND, GITA, IRM, and Project MIRACLE. The throughline of his work lies in reimagining how societies generate value—shifting from extractive models to regenerative, life-centered systems that empower local communities. He’s particularly focused on helogenic civilization frameworks, bio-regional material commons, infrastructures of generosity, systemic change methodologies, and the intersections of technology, culture, and ecology. Motivated by the conviction that aligning collective creativity, open protocols, and local agency is essential to address today’s ecological and existential challenges, he writes, speaks, convenes and assemblies to catalyze these conversations and collaborations.

He was the first to demonstrate the existence of "blindsight" in monkeys, studied mountain gorillas with Dian Fossey in Rwanda, proposed the celebrated theory of the "social function of intellect," and has investigated the evolutionary background of religion, art, healing, death-awareness, and suicide. His honours include the Martin Luther King Memorial Prize, the Pufendorf Medal, and the International Mind and Brain Prize. His most recent books are <em>Seeing Red</em>, <em>Soul Dust</em>, and <em>Sentience</em>.

Lee Cronin is a chemist. He is the Regius Professor of Chemistry at the University of Glasgow and the Founder &amp; CEO of Chemify. He is known for his approach to the digitization of chemistry and developing digital-to-chemical transformation known as Chemputing which can turn code into reactions and molecules. He has also developed a new theory for evolution and selection called assembly theory which aims to quantify and explain how selection can occur in chemistry before biology. Lee is also exploring how chemical systems can compute, and what is needed for the evolution of intelligence, as well as designing a new type of computational system that uses information encoded in chemical reactions and molecules.

James Fadiman, Ph.D., is a prominent figure in the field of psychedelic research, particularly known for his work on microdosing psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin. Often called the “father of microdosing,” Fadiman has a long history in the study of psychedelics dating back to the 1960s, when he worked on studies involving LSD and creativity while at Stanford University. After psychedelics were banned in the U.S., Fadiman shifted his focus but returned to psychedelic research decades later. His book, <em>The Psychedelic Explorer’s Guide: Safe, Therapeutic, and Sacred Journeys</em>, has become a key resource for safe psychedelic exploration. In recent years, he has pioneered research on microdosing, examining its potential benefits for mental health, cognitive enhancement, and overall well-being.

Jordan Gruber, JD, MA, founded the early online Enlightenment.Com community. After practicing law at Cooley Godward and focusing on IP law at NASA’s Moffett Field, as well as working at <em>GNOSIS Magazine</em>, Jordan became “the Practical Wordsmith,” a writer, ghostwriter, editor, and writing coach speciliazing in transformational modalities and practices. Jordan has helped create cutting-edge works on everything from forensic audio and financial services to health, wellness, psychology, and spirituality. Recent editing credits include Cindy Lou Golin’s <em>The Shadow Playbook</em> (2023), Scott Rogers’s <em>The Mindful Law Student</em> (2022), and Lawrence Ford’s <em>The Secrets of the Seasons </em>(2020).

They discuss pluralism as a core principle in designing social systems, the informational basis for alignment, how preferential models fail to capture what people truly care about, the limitations of markets and voting as preference-based systems, critiques of text-based approaches in LLMs, thick models of value, values as attentional policies, AI assistants as potential vectors for manipulation, the need for reputation systems and factual grounding, the "super negotiator" project for better contract negotiation, multipolar traps, moral graph elicitation, starting with membranes, Moloch-free zones, unintended consequences and lessons from early Internet optimism, concentration of power as a key danger, co-optation risks, and much more.</div>

<span class="il">Joe Edelman</span> has spent much of his life trying to understand how ML systems and markets could change, retaining their many benefits but avoiding their characteristic problems: of atomization, and of servicing shallow desires over deeper needs. Along the way this led him to formulate theories of human meaning and values (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10636" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10636&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1759958247269000&amp;usg=AOvVaw38HsbPOG9H-XW-T8Qyk0wu">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.<wbr />10636</a>) and study models of societal transformation (<a href="https://www.full-stack-alignment.ai/paper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.full-stack-alignment.ai/paper&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1759958247269000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2VfUyrmMUmrwcFVKNsHtxR">https://www.full-stack-<wbr />alignment.ai/paper</a>) as well as inventing the meaning-based metrics used at CouchSurfing, Facebook, and Apple, co-founding the Center for Humane Technology and the Meaning Alignment Institute, and inventing new democratic systems (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10636" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10636&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1759958247269000&amp;usg=AOvVaw38HsbPOG9H-XW-T8Qyk0wu">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.<wbr />10636</a>).

Jim talks with Alex Ebert about the ideas in his Substack essay "New Age and the Religion of Self: The Anatomy of a Rebellion Against Reality." They discuss the meanings of New Age and religion, the New Thought movement, the law of attraction, manifesting, Trump's artifacts of manifestation, the unmooring from concrete artifacts, individual and collective hallucinations, intersubjective verification of the interobjective, the subjective-first perspective, epistemic asymmetry as the cool, New Ageism's constant reference to quantum physics, manifesting as a way to negate social responsibility, the odd coincidence of leaving the gold standard and New Ageism, spiritual bypassing, a global derealization, new retribalized collective delusions, the Faustian bargain of AI, rationality as a virus, the noble lie, indeterminacy as a sign of emergence, nostalgia as a sales pitch, regaining the sense of hypocrisy, localized retribalizations, GameB as a series of membranes, and much more.

Jim talks with Nate Soares about the ideas in his and Eliezer Yudkowsky's book <i>If Anybody Builds It, Everyone Dies: Why Superhuman AI Would Kill Us All</i>. They discuss the book's claim that mitigating existential AI risk should be a top global priority, the idea that LLMs are grown, the opacity of deep learning networks, the Golden Gate activation vector, whether our understanding of deep learning networks might improve enough to prevent catastrophe, goodness as a narrow target, the alignment problem, the problem of pointing minds, whether LLMs are just stochastic parrots, why predicting a corpus often requires more mental machinery than creating a corpus, depth &amp; generalization of skills, wanting as an effective strategy, goal orientation, limitations of training goal pursuit, transient limitations of current AI, protein folding and AlphaFold, the riskiness of automating alignment research, the correlation between capability and more coherent drives, why the authors anchored their argument on transformers &amp; LLMs, the inversion of Moravec's paradox, the geopolitical multipolar trap, making world leaders aware of the issues, a treaty to ban the race to superintelligence, the specific terms of the proposed treaty, a comparison with banning uranium enrichment, why Jim tentatively thinks this proposal is a mistake, a priesthood of the power supply, whether attention is a zero-sum game, and much more.

<div>Continuing his series of expert interviews on the unfolding situation in Ukraine, Jim talks with Paul Goble, a longtime specialist on ethnic and religious issues in Eurasia. They discuss Putin's view of Russia as neglected &amp; ignored, Russians' difficulty making ethnic distinctions between Ukrainian &amp; Russians, Putin's unintentional unification of Ukraine &amp; NATO, what Putin &amp; most analysts got wrong about the military balance, Putin's misplaced faith in superior firepower, the ethnic makeup of the Russian military, why the backlash from the West was stronger than Putin expected, the West's unprecedented non-kinetic response to the invasion, effects &amp; non-effects of the Western sanction regime, Russia's infosphere &amp; increasingly closed internet, why Russian anti-war sentiment will increase, challenging bets against a continued Ukrainian resistance, Ukrainian resistance to the Soviet Red Army in 1945-1955, high effectiveness of low-tech resistance, Putin's coming claim of victory &amp; why it would be Pyrrhic, what Putin would do in reaction to violence against him, the likelihood that NATO's increased coherence will continue, why China will probably not move on Taiwan in the near term, and much more.</div>

Matthew <span class="il">Pirk</span><span class="il">owsk</span><span class="il">i</span> works at the intersection of software, psychology, and complex systems. These interests first took root while studying Evolutionary Psychology and assisting with Behavioral Economic research at Yale’s Comparative Cognition Laboratory. From there Matthew began a career in software engineering, where he applied these interests to the development of software interfaces used by millions around the world, most notably as a member of Netflix’s Television UI team, where he worked on experimental initiatives conceptualizing and prototyping the future of entertainment software. Presently, Matthew consults on systems architecture, advises companies within the startup space, and writes about topics related to the evolution of human socioeconomic, technological, and representational systems–in particular the emergence and impact of cryptoeconomic protocols, as outlined in his <a title="https://medium.com/hackernoon/crypto-beyond-capitalism-the-rise-of-distributed-valerism-7e3c1285a308" href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/crypto-beyond-capitalism-the-rise-of-distributed-valerism-7e3c1285a308" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/hackernoon/crypto-beyond-capitalism-the-rise-of-distributed-valerism-7e3c1285a308&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1646169371607000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2PLtHNHjrtV37mzpIoI2Nx">Crypto Beyond Capitalism</a> essay series.

Technosocial is a space for thinking about the fringes of the internet and exploring how technology is reshaping society. Only from this excess does "Project" become possible.

<span class="il">Euvie</span> Ivanova is a media producer, speaker, educator, and mama. She is the co-founder of FutureThinkers.org, a podcast and community dedicated to the evolution of society, technology, and consciousness towards a regenerative future. She is currently in the early stages of building a regenerative village in Canada.

Bonnitta Roy teaches insight practices for individuals who are developing meta-cognitive skills, and hosts collective insight retreats to help groups break away from limiting patterns of thought. Her teaching highlights the embodied, affective and perceptual aspects of the core self, and the non-egoic potentials from which subtle sensing, intuition and insight emerge. In 2021 she started the POP-UP School to bring her teaching to a larger audience. Through her company, C-LABS,  Bonnitta is developing applications that can visualize changing patterns as teams work through complex problems. Her research shows how simple but powerful protocols that underlie these patterns can be used to represent various dispositional states of human systems. Bonnitta is the author of the popular Medium publication <em>Our Future at Work</em>. She is an associate editor of <em>Integral Review</em> where you can also find her articles on process approaches to consciousness, perception, and metaphysics.

Jessica Flack is a professor at the Santa Fe Institute. Flack directs SFI's <a title="C4HOME" href="http://c4.santafe.edu/">Collective Computation Group (C4)</a>. Flack was formerly founding director of the Center for Complexity and Collective Computation in the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Flack received her PhD from Emory in 2003, studying cognitive science, animal behavior and evolutionary theory, and BA with honors from Cornell in 1996. Flack's work has been covered by scientists and science journalists in many publications and media outlets, including <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-nature-solves-problems-through-computation-20170706/">Quanta Magazine</a>, the BBC, NPR, Nature, Science, The Economist, New Scientist, and Current Biology.

Flack's research focuses on collective computation and its role in the emergence of robust structure and function in nature and society. A central philosophical issue behind this work is how nature overcomes subjectivity inherent in information processing systems to produce collective, ordered states.

Continuing his series of expert interviews on the Russia-Ukraine War, Jim talks again with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/johnrobb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Robb</a>, this time about the likelihood of a settlement. They discuss the pressures currently pushing both sides against negotiating, why Russia is opposed to Ukraine joining the EU, the likelihood of an ongoing stalemate, why WWI is a better analogue for this war than WWII, the current balance of forces in Ukraine &amp; absence of data on Ukrainian losses, Russia's failure to take advantage of drones and smart weapons, why Russia has underachieved compared with analyst predictions, the downside of closed societies &amp; nepotism, transition points that could change willingness to settle, Putin's "maximum acceptable atrocity" restraint, the possibility of nuclear escalation, a new network mechanism for collective security, the overblown narrative of Russian disinformation capacity, why Russia hasn't destroyed Ukraine's communications infrastructure, strategic implications of global network warfare, coming rapid improvements in drone tech, and much more.

These interests first took root while studying Evolutionary Psychology and assisting with Behavioral Economic research at Yale's Comparative Cognition Laboratory. From there Matthew began a career in software engineering, where he applied these interests to the development of software interfaces used by millions around the world, most notably as a member of Netflix's Television UI team, where he worked on experimental initiatives conceptualizing and prototyping the future of entertainment software. Presently, Matthew consults on systems architecture, advises companies within the startup space, and writes about topics related to the evolution of human socioeconomic, technological, and representational systems–in particular the emergence and impact of cryptoeconomic protocols, as outlined in his <a title="https://medium.com/hackernoon/crypto-beyond-capitalism-the-rise-of-distributed-valerism-7e3c1285a308" href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/crypto-beyond-capitalism-the-rise-of-distributed-valerism-7e3c1285a308" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/hackernoon/crypto-beyond-capitalism-the-rise-of-distributed-valerism-7e3c1285a308&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1646169371607000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2PLtHNHjrtV37mzpIoI2Nx">Crypto Beyond Capitalism</a> essay series.

Since then, he's worked on the philosophical underpinnings for new business metrics, design methods, and political movements. The central idea is to make people's sources of meaning explicit, so that how meaningful or meaningless things are can be rigorously accounted for. His previous career was in HCI and programming language design.

<a href="https://www.gregghenriques.com/">Dr. Gregg Henriques</a> is currently utilizing his Unified Theory of Psychology to systematically study character and well-being, social motivation and emotion, and to develop a more unified approach to psychotherapy. Dr. Henriques (Full Professor) has been a core faculty member in James Madison University’s Combined-Integrated Clinical and School Psychology Doctoral Program. He arrived at JMU in 2003, and directed the C-I doctoral program from 2005 to 2017. In addition to providing administrative oversight of the program, he also engages in clinical supervision and teaches courses on social and personality psychology, integrative psychotherapy and history and systems. In 2011 he outlined his approach in a book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12743782-a-new-unified-theory-of-psychology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>A New Unified Theory of Psychology</em></a>, (Springer, 2011). For the past several years, he has authored a Psychology Today blog called <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/theory-knowledge">Theory of Knowledge</a>, which offers weekly blog posts on a wide variety of topics related to his view for a more unified field. Dr. Henriques also has expertise in the assessment and treatment of severe psychopathology, particularly depression and suicide, and is currently a licensed clinical psychologist in Virginia.

Bonnitta Roy teaches insight practices for individuals who are developing meta-cognitive skills, and hosts collective insight retreats for groups interested in breaking away from limiting patterns of thought. She teaches a masters course in consciousness studies and transpersonal psychology at the Graduate Institute. Her teaching highlights the embodied, affective and perceptual aspects of the core self, and the non-egoic potentials from which subtle sensing, intuition and insight emerge.

Through her company, APP-AI, Bonnitta is developing applications that can visualize changing patterns as teams work through complex problems. Her research shows how simple but powerful protocols that underlie these patterns can be used to represent various dispositional states of human systems. Bonnitta is the author of the popular Medium publication <em>Our Future at Work</em>. She is an associate editor of <em>Integral Review</em> where you can also find her articles on process approaches to consciousness, perception, and metaphysics.

Matthew Pirkowski works at the intersection of software, psychology, and complex systems. These interests first took root while studying Evolutionary Psychology and assisting with Behavioral Economic research at Yale’s Comparative Cognition Laboratory. From there Matthew began a career in software engineering, where he applied these interests to the development of software interfaces used by millions around the world, most notably as a member of Netflix’s Television UI team, where he worked on experimental initiatives conceptualizing and prototyping the future of entertainment software.

Presently, Matthew is building the underlying modeling architecture at Bioform Labs, a company focused on using the Active Inference toolkit to model organizations as emergent cybernetic organisms. He believes these models can help organizations manage their deployment of and interaction with AI-based agents, as well as more adaptively manage their own emergent complexity.

Yarvin further says a central thesis of neoreaction is that accomplishing this goal requires a critical re-evaluation of “<a href="https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2007/04/case-against-democracy-ten-red-pills/">democracy</a>” from the perspective of <em>political engineering</em> and informed by a study of the great political thinkers of the past.

</ul>
Simon DeDeo is an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University in the Department of Social and Decision Sciences, and External Professor at the <a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~simon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Santa Fe Institute</a>. He is also affiliated with the Cognitive Science program at Indiana University, where he runs the Laboratory for Social Minds. For three years, from 2010 to 2013, he was an Omidyar Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute.

He and his collaborators study how people use words and signals, and the ideas they represent, to create a world. They have studied a diverse set of systems that includes the French Revolution, the courtrooms of Victorian London, the research strategies of Charles Darwin, the insurgency of modern-day Afghanistan, the emergent bureaucracy of Wikipedia, the creation of power hierarchies among the social animals, and the collusions and conspiracies of petrol stations in the American Midwest. They combine data from the contemporary world, archives from the deep past, statistical tools from cosmology, and models of human cognition from Bayesian reasoning and information theory to understand how cultures grow, flourish, innovate, and evolve.

The throughline of his interests has to do with ways of improving the health and development of individuals and society, with a virtuous relationship between the two as a goal. Towards these ends, he’s had particular interest in the topics of catastrophic and existential risk, civilization and institutional decay and collapse as well as progress, collective action problems, social organization theories, and the relevant domains in philosophy and science. Motivated by the belief that advancing collective intelligence and capacity is foundational to the integrity of any civilization, and necessary to address the unique risks we currently face given the intersection of globalization and exponential technology, he has spoken publicly on many of these topics, hoping to popularize and deepen important conversations and engage more people in working towards their solutions. Many of these can be found here.</p>

Continuing his series of expert interviews on the Russia-Ukraine War, Jim talks again with <a href="https://samoburja.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samo Burja</a> about the state of the Russian advance one month in. They discuss Putin's maximum acceptable atrocity level, the complex relationship between public opinion and intervention, Russia's need for a symbolic victory, meaning &amp; impact of the West's surprisingly coherent network counterattack, importance of the white-collar bureaucratic class's Twitter addiction, conditions that might move the situation toward settlement, a never-ending ceasefire, the symmetry of Russian and Ukrainian forces, what might happen if Zelensky were killed, the Russian failure to engage in 5G warfare, whether the balance between offense and defense has shifted, whether collective network response might become an effective war deterrent, what China &amp; other nations are taking away from the conflict so far, and much more.

Simon DeDeo is an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University in the Department of Social and Decision Sciences, and External Professor at the <a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~simon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Santa Fe Institute</a>. He is also affiliated with the Cognitive Science program at Indiana University, where he runs the Laboratory for Social Minds. For three years, from 2010 to 2013, he was an Omidyar Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute. He and his collaborators study how people use words and signals, and the ideas they represent, to create a world. They have studied a diverse set of systems that includes the French Revolution, the courtrooms of Victorian London, the research strategies of Charles Darwin, the insurgency of modern-day Afghanistan, the emergent bureaucracy of Wikipedia, the creation of power hierarchies among the social animals, and the collusions and conspiracies of petrol stations in the American Midwest. They combine data from the contemporary world, archives from the deep past, statistical tools from cosmology, and models of human cognition from Bayesian reasoning and information theory to understand how cultures grow, flourish, innovate, and evolve.

They discuss the Grand Narrative Trilogy Bard has been writing with Jan Söderqvist, the kinds of stories we tell about ourselves, why Hiroshima remains the signal event of modern history, fostering symbiotic intelligence, the difference between the GameA &amp; the GameB mythos, imploitation vs exploitation, 3 historical roots of GameA, why AI &amp; not humans may conquer space, jettisoning the Gnostic dualism of Greek philosophy, protopianism over utopianism, voluntary communist protopias, increasing well-being while reducing energy consumption, designing membranes &amp; protocols, reclaiming "gated community," a designed opposition between GameB &amp; the Dark Renaissance, reversing the ban on pathos, the Zoroastrian approach to contingency &amp; ethics, and much more.</div>

<a href="https://twitter.com/Bardissimo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexander Bard</a> is a philosopher, futurologist, and political and spiritual activist, based in Stockholm, Sweden. He is the author of five books: <i>The Netocrats</i>, <i>The Global Empire</i>, <i>The Body Machines</i>, <i>Syntheism – Creating God in The Internet Age</i>, and <i>Digital Libido – Sex, Power and Violence in The Network Society</i> with his co-writer Jan Söderqvist. Bard is a radical process philosopher, merging Hegel and Nietzsche with Whitehead and Deleuze, using humanity as the constant and technology as the variable while working toward the deepest possible understanding of human history, contemporary society, and the intensely technology-driven future that humanity is facing. Bard has also enjoyed a highly successful 25-year-career as a producer and artist in the international music industry, followed by ten years as a tough love, reality-checking judge on TV shows “Swedish Idol” and “Sweden’s Got Talent”, and is an outspoken and provocative YouTube and Twitter celebrity.

They discuss the consequences of a (likely) Russian victory, Russia's bet on new arctic ports &amp; liquid natural gas, a final decoupling of Russia from Europe, the stalemate scenario, Ukraine's dearth of young men, its remarkable job so far at maintaining morale, the likelihood of escalation of mass artillery &amp; casualties, incompatibility between atomized individualism &amp; willingness to resist, rational &amp; less rational reasons why Russia hasn't taken out Ukraine's hospitals, power plants, and internet, a scenario in which Russia settles for Luhansk and Dinetzk, what a true Russian defeat would look like, significance of the Russian advance through Crimea, Samo's main critique of the Ukrainian government, the key fact that Russia has not yet used a third of their forces, the ineffectual negotations in Belarus, the always-looming risk of nuclear escalation &amp; whether the nuclear taboo will hold, an unlikely escalation path via Polish involvement, why a strong German military would be bad for the EU, how a Russian victory would embolden China to invade Taiwan &amp; China's tacit support of the Russian invasion, a bet between Jim &amp; Samo on whether China invades Taiwan within the next 3 years, and much more.</div>

</ul>


Simon DeDeo is an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University in the Department of Social and Decision Sciences, and External Professor at the <a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~simon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Santa Fe Institute</a>. He is also affiliated with the Cognitive Science program at Indiana University, where he runs the Laboratory for Social Minds. For three years, from 2010 to 2013, he was an Omidyar Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute.

He and his collaborators study how people use words and signals, and the ideas they represent, to create a world. They have studied a diverse set of systems that includes the French Revolution, the courtrooms of Victorian London, the research strategies of Charles Darwin, the insurgency of modern-day Afghanistan, the emergent bureaucracy of Wikipedia, the creation of power hierarchies among the social animals, and the collusions and conspiracies of petrol stations in the American Midwest. They combine data from the contemporary world, archives from the deep past, statistical tools from cosmology, and models of human cognition from Bayesian reasoning and information theory to understand how cultures grow, flourish, innovate, and evolve.

Canadian-born Dr. Bruce Damer has spent his life pursuing two questions: <em>how did life on Earth begin? </em>and<em> how can we give that life (and ourselves) a sustainable pathway into the future and a presence beyond the Earth?</em> A decade of laboratory and field research with his collaborator Prof. David Deamer at UCSC and teams around the world resulted in the <em>Hot Spring Hypothesis for an Origin of Life</em>, published in Scientific American in 2017 and the journal Astrobiology in 2020. The scenario has now passed its first key experimental tests in the laboratory and at volcanic hot springs around the world and has emerged as a leading contender for a general theory of abiogenesis. Implications of the work are now spreading through evolutionary biology, philosophy, AI and the search for life beyond Earth. New work with collaborators has proposed the <em>urability</em> framework, how life can start on many different worlds, and addresses some aspects of the Fermi Paradox.

Professor <span class="il">Sara</span> <span class="il">Walker</span> is an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist. Her work focuses on the origins and nature of life, and in particular whether or not there are universal ‘laws of life’ that would allow predicting when life emerges and can guide our search for other examples on other worlds.  Her research integrates diverse perspectives ranging from chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy and the foundations of physics, to computer science, cheminformatics, artificial life, artificial intelligence and consciousness. At Arizona State University she is Deputy Director of the Beyond Center for Fundamental Concepts in Science, Associate Director of the ASU-Santa Fe Institute Center for Biosocial Complex Systems and Professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration. She is also a member of the External Faculty at the Santa Fe Institute. She is active in public engagement in science, with appearances on "Through the Wormhole", NPR's Science Friday, and on a number of international science festivals and podcasts. She has published in leading research journals and is an internationally recognized thought leader in the study of the origins of life, alien life and the search for a deeper understanding of ourselves in our universe.

Leroy (Lee) Cronin is the Regius Professor of Chemistry in Glasgow. Since the age of 9 Lee has wanted to explore chemistry using electronics to control matter. His research spans many disciplines and has four main aims: the construction of an artificial life form; the digitization of chemistry; the use of artificial intelligence in chemistry including the construction of ‘wet’ chemical computers; the exploration of complexity and information in chemistry. His recent work on the digitization of chemistry has resulted in a new programming paradigm for matter and organic synthesis and discovery – chemputation – which uses the worlds first domain specific and universal programming language for chemistry – XDL, see XDL-standard.com. His team designs and builds all their own robots from the ground up and the team currently has 25 different robotic systems operating across four domains: Organic synthesis; Energy materials discovery; Nanomaterials discovery; Formulation discovery. All the systems use XDL and are easily programmable for both manufacture and discovery. His group is organised and assembled transparently around ideas, avoids hierarchy, and aims to mentor researchers using a problem-based approach. Nothing is impossible until it is tried.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Timothy Clancy has an MSc from WPI in Insurgency Dynamics &amp; Simulation Science. As a Ph.D. candidate, he is preparing to defend his dissertation on the life-cycle of violence and instability of non-state actors as a complex system of studied simulations. His published research includes a simulation model of ISIS in Syria and Iraq and another of violent radicalization leading to terrorism as a social contagion.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Timothy runs a blog, InfoMullet.com or @InfoMullet on Twitter or Facebook, that provides more context for complex current events. Through the InfoMullet he’s tracked regional conflicts relevant to the current Russian invasion as far back as the Second Chechnyan war through Georgia, Syria, Libya, and most recently Armenia v. Azerbaijan. He also provides focused coverage on uprisings and non-state actor conflict including EuroMaidan protest movements which 8 years ago this February led to the collapse of the Yanukovych regime, Russian annexation of Crimea, and the start of the Russo-Ukrainian war in 2014.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">His consulting firm Dialectic Simulations Consulting helps clients ranging from Fortune 1000 to government agencies and military commands solve some of their toughest problems with simulations.</p>

Jordan is the Co-founder and Executive Chairman of the <a href="https://neurohacker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neurohacker Collective</a>. He is now in his 17th year of building disruptive technology companies. Jordan’s interests in comics, science fiction, computers, and way too much TV led to a deep dive into contemporary philosophy (particularly the works of Gilles Deleuze and Manuel DeLanda), artificial intelligence and complex systems science, and then, as the Internet was exploding into the world, a few years at Harvard Law School where he spent time with Larry Lessig, Jonathan Zittrain and Cornel West examining the coevolution of human civilization and technology.
